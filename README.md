First of all, welcome to my page. I used bootstrap 5 everything that appears on my page. However, I used bootstrap 4 in one part (peripherals). Since my site is a bootstrap 5 project, I changed some codes for 5 on it. This is my first project for Bootstrap. I talked about computer parts as content on my page, I talked about the parts inside the computer case and basic computer peripherals without going into too much detail. That's it for my page for my first project.
